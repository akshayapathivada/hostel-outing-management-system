**Online Outing Management System**

The Online Outing Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of managing outing requests for educational institutions. It provides a centralized platform for students, faculty members, and wardens to efficiently handle outing applications, approvals, and supervision.

**Key Features**

**Student Module:**

Students can log in to the system and view their profile, which displays personal details such as name, branch, registration number, year of study, and phone number. They can submit outing applications by filling out a form with relevant information, including the reason for the outing and the dates. The status of their application is visible, indicating whether it is accepted, rejected, or under review.

**Faculty Module:**

Faculty members can log in and access a list of students who have applied for outings. They can view the details provided by each student in their application form and make a decision to accept or reject the application. The status of the application is communicated back to the student upon faculty approval.

**Warden Module:**

Wardens have multiple options based on the year groups. They can view the list of students who have applied for outings and received faculty approval for a specific year group. The warden then contacts the student's parent to discuss and make a final decision on accepting or rejecting the application. The student receives an acknowledgment based on the warden's decision. The warden also has a search functionality to find a specific student by their registration number and determine their current location (inside or outside the college).
